# Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined EK2 Compatibility

This is a [Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/204734-mod-carnalitas-slavery-reimagined/) compatibility patch for [Elder Kings 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2887120253). For an overview of features and other changes, see the README of the main mod.

## Council and Court Positions

Starting with version 0.4.0, the main CSR mod integrates the slavery system also with council and court positions. Since EK2 also makes changes to court positions, one of the main purposes of this compatibility mod is to reconcile these changes.

### Changes to Existing Council and Court Positions

The main CSR mod divides the existing council and court positions into ones that are available to slaves (always or only for certain government forms), and ones that are not available to slaves at all.

In addition to the 14 court positions that are available to slaves in CSR, the following EK2 court positions are also available to slaves: *Court Mage*, *Loremaster*, *Shadowscale*, and *Speaker*. The remaining 4 EK2 court positions are not available to slaves. 3 of them (*Huntwife*, *Forgewife*, *Heartife*) are only available to spouses, and slaves can never be ones. The fourth one (*Housecarl*) is a position of high authority and prestige, so deemed inappropriate for a slave.

### Availability of Council Positions to Slaves

In the main CSR mod, *Chancellor*, *Steward*, and *Marshal* are only available to slaves if your government is clan or tribal. In CSR EK2, they are available to slaves also if your government form is autocracy or pirate.
